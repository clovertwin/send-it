# send-it

## Project overview
This project is a basic real-time chat application using node, express, react, and socket.io. The front-end is deployed using 
netlify and the backend is deployed on a free heroku server (will take a few seconds to spin up the free server on first entering chat). 

## Login
To login use any name you want, and any chat-room name you want. If someone else joins the same room name they will enter the chat with you.
On first entering the chat room wait for the automated reply confirming you have connected to the room before entering messages.
